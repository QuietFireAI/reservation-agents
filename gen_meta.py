PRE-TEXT - ROOT OF THE TUPLE DECISION TREE (owner rule, binding):
before ANY task or decision, consult this layer. If NO suitable tuple covers
the task: STOP. Contact the human via clarification.request and wait. Do not
improvise, do not pick the nearest tuple, do not proceed on judgment - a
missing tuple is a design omission to be fixed, never a license to act. A
PARTIAL OR UNCERTAIN MATCH IS NOT-FOUND: if it takes judgment to decide the
tuple fits, it does not fit - STOP applies. The after-action proposes the
missing tuple so the omission is closed.

Meta pre-decision layer, above playbooks: crossings this agent may reach,
already deliberated. Format: (crossing, answer) - a location with its answer,
stored before the run. Swarm-wide tuples in /SWARM.md apply first; MANNERS.md
constrains everything.

Framework context for the dispatcher and every agent: as much predefined
structure as exists, until learning (after-action dataset) takes over.
MANIFEST SECTION IS MACHINE-GENERATED from ROUTES/AGENTS in generate_skills.py
 -  regenerate via gen_meta.py; hand-edits here will be overwritten and are a
defect, not a change.

## Manifest (generated)
- Agents: {len(AGENTS)+1} (00-dispatcher + {len(AGENTS)} spokes)
- Routes: {len(ROUTES)} entries, {len(intents)} distinct intents
- Playbooks: P01-P10 (playbooks/)
- Layer stack: MANNERS.md → DISPATCHER_CORE.md → identity/ → DECISIONS.md
  (per agent) → playbooks/ → agent SKILL.md files
- Track principle: the ROUTE-SPACE IS CLOSED. Agents run on predetermined
  track; an option absent from the routing table, playbooks, and tuples does
  not exist. Trains request routes; only the hub lines switches. Content-space
  is BOUNDED (manners, compliance verdicts) but not closed - generative freight
  is why inspection exists (02's capacity ceiling, verify_swarm, after-action).
- Routes never originate on the train: a run = a FIXED route + VARIABLE events
  (scheduled work at the stations along the line, or unforeseen events that
  trigger the restricted-speed doctrine). Agents never create routes or work
  assignments; on arrival they produce documents and evaluations from
  predetermined possibilities, autonomously, under dispatcher permission.
- Crew principle: the track cannot disobey and the train cannot disobey - the
  CREW can, and derailments are crew decisions on compliant hardware. In this
  swarm the model is the crew, not the train. Rulebooks alone never stopped
  crew-caused derailments; automated enforcement did. Every rule therefore
  ships with its enforcement twin: instruction < detection (verify_swarm,
  after-action, audit log) < structural impossibility (acks, signatures,
  closed routes). Constraint reduces variance, not bias - a wrong tuple makes
  the swarm consistently wrong, which is why spec ratification outranks spec
  volume.
- Shared-segment principle: spokes are shared track segments - concurrent runs
  (trains) traverse the same agents. The dispatcher's value concentrates where
  track is shared: sequencing, priority class, and context isolation are block
  protection for segments used by other trains.
- Spokes:
{agents_list}
- Intents: {", ".join(f"`{i}`" for i in intents)}

## Swarm-level decision tuples (predictable scenarios, pre-deliberated)

Status: v0.1 ratified 2026-07-11 (owner sign-off) - manifest verified against generator data at generation
time; not runtime-tested.
